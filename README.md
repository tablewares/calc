# calc
calc is short for calculator

A simple calculator that just takes the expression, splits it by the expression types, and then performs the main calculation
Very simple, only goes from left to right, no precedents (i.e parathensis goes first) 
Not designed for serious use

example usage
9 x 3 + 21 - 34 = 14 because 9 x 3 = 27, 27 + 21 = 48, and 48 - 34 = 14
